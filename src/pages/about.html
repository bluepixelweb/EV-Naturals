		<p class="cs-text">
			At EV Naturals we strive to provide our customers with not only the best CBD products on the market today, but also provide the best customer service, and education. We try to provide a personalized experience with every customer in order to find the best products to suit their needs. CBD products are a relatively new addition to the market, and there are a lot of myths, misunderstandings, and misinformation surrounding CBD. It can be difficult to navigate through all of the information, separating fact from fiction, and we are passionate about educating our customers and providing them with the tools to make informed decisions.            </p>
		<p class="cs-text">
			We started this business because of how much CBD personally improved the quality of life for ourselves, as well as friends and family. However, we quickly found out that not all CBD products are created equal, not all CBD companies are legitimate, and you most definitely can't believe everything you read on the internet. 
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">
			Drawing from our experiences, it is our goal to assist our customers so that they don't have to go through the lengthy learning process like we did. We do this by providing a wide  range of products from some of the world's best CBD companies. We determined this by only carrying companies that not only have a good reputation in the industry, but can provide third-party lab testing on all of their products, which we are in turn able to provide to all of our customers.Lab tested products are extremely important, because it is the only way that you can ensure what is actually in the product you are purchasing. Presently, it is not an industry requirement to provide lab testing documentation, and many companies out there do not even bother with it. However, it is our requirement as a business to only carry products from companies that do.
